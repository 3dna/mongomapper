MongoMapper needs your help to make the documentation better. Fork the "repo on GitHub":http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper and check out the gh-pages branch.

h2. Suggestions

Here are some ways you can contribute:

* "Modifiers":https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/blob/master/lib/mongo_mapper/plugins/modifiers.rb
* "Serialization":https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/blob/master/lib/mongo_mapper/plugins/serialization.rb
* "Association methods (many, belongs_to, one)":https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/blob/master/lib/mongo_mapper/plugins/associations.rb
* Polymorphic associations

h2. Guidelines

In order to maintain quality, here are some guidelines for contributing to the MongoMapper documentation.

* Don't document hacks or workarounds. If MongoMapper is broken or doesn't support something, note it in the docs and add an issue to the "issue tracker":http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/issues.
* Avoid narratives. People don't really care why you're writing the documentation, they just want to know how to use MongoMapper.
* Be concise without sacrificing clarity.
