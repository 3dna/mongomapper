I'm happy to announce the new MongoMapper.com. This site will be a home for all things MongoMapper, including documentation, tutorials, and announcements.

This site marks a maturation of MongoMapper. What started as an experiment, simply to learn MongoDB, has turned into a nice piece of software with a wonderful community wrapped around it.

h2. Documentation

MongoMapper now has some "documentation":/documentation/. It is far from comprehensive or complete, but it is a good start. Thanks to these people for contributing.

There is a lot of work to do, so "please help us out":/documentation/contributing.html.

h2. Roadmap

In the coming days, MongoMapper 0.9 will be released. It is the first release specifically targeting Rails 3. There may be one more 0.8.x release for Rails 2, but the future is focused on Rails 3.

After 0.9 is released, 1.0 will soon follow.
